* Features                                                              :TOC:
The main features of Pachemacs are Vi emulation (evil-mode), Emacs as Window Manager (exwm), helm, corfu, vertico and some programming languages support with eglot.
There are also some functions for downloading media with yt-dlp, converting videos with ffmpeg, Kensington Orbit trackball configuration via xinput etc.

* Installing :TOC:
Backup or delete your current .emacs.d directory and clone this repo:
#+BEGIN_SRC
  git clone --depth=1 https://github.com/0xhenrique/pachemacs.git ~/.emacs.d
#+END_SRC
Simple as that. But if you're willing to use EXWM I recommend that you read further.

* How to remove unwanted things :TOC:
There's a file called =init.el= where you can simply comment or delete some of the lisp/modules.

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  ;; If you're not an EXWM enjoyer, you can remove or comment the line below
  (load "~/.emacs.d/lisp/pache-exwm.el")
  ;; If you're not an Evil enjoyer, you might also want to remove pache-evil below
  (load "~/.emacs.d/lisp/pache-evil.el")
  (load "~/.emacs.d/lisp/pache-ui.el")
  (load "~/.emacs.d/lisp/pache-win.el")
  (load "~/.emacs.d/lisp/pache-keys.el")
  (load "~/.emacs.d/lisp/pache-misc.el")
  (load "~/.emacs.d/lisp/pache-utils.el")
  (load "~/.emacs.d/lisp/pache-yas.el")
  (load "~/.emacs.d/lisp/pache-programming.el")
  (load "~/.emacs.d/lisp/pache-irc.el")
  (load "~/.emacs.d/lisp/pache-media.el")
#+END_SRC

Beware that some of those modules are required to run Pachemacs.
Be careful when removing it.
There is a github issue to track this problem. You can check it [[https://github.com/0xhenrique/pachemacs/issues/2][here]].

* How to create new modules :TOC:
If you want to create a new module for you, then create a new file:
#+BEGIN_SRC bash
  touch ~/.emacs.d/lisp/pache-module.el
#+END_SRC

Add the following boilerplate to the newly created module:
#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  ;;; pache-custom.el --- Custom Module Settings -*- lexical-binding: t -*-
  ;;; Commentary:
  ;;; Code:

  ;; This is just an example
  (setq gc-cons-threshold 100000000
	read-process-output-max (* (* 1024 1024) 3)
	inhibit-compacting-font-caches t)
  (run-with-idle-timer 2 t (lambda () (garbage-collect)))

  (provide 'pache-custom)
  ;;; pache-custom.el ends here
#+END_SRC

And call it in the =init.el= file like this:
#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(load "~/.emacs.d/lisp/pache-custom.el")
#+END_SRC
